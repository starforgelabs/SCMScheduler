Simple Co√∂perative Multitasking Scheduler for Arduino

This is an experiment from an idea implemented in the Hallowe'en Eyes project. 

It's a minimalistic round-robin scheduler for simple processes that will kindly return in a timely manner.
Granted, this is full of holes, but it's a playground for simple machines.
